    "## 1 Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you're faced with a decision-making problem where you need to classify something into one of two categories. It might be determining if a bank loan should be approved or denied, or predicting if a student will pass or fail a test based on their study hours. You collect the necessary data, and your task is to find a way to make sense of it to arrive at a clear decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic regression is the tool that can help you with this. Unlike linear regression, which is used to predict continuous values (values that can fall within a range, such as temperatures or prices), logistic regression is designed for binary decisions: yes or no, true or false, 1 or 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "At its core, logistic regression works by taking your input data and transforming it into a probability, a chance that the answer is 'yes' or 'no'. It doesn't just draw a straight line through the data points but shapes a curve called the [sigmoid function](#32-understanding-the-sigmoid-function) that best represents the relationship between the variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have found this mathematical expression, you can use it to make predictions with confidence. You'll know not just whether the answer is 'yes' or 'no', but also how confident you can be in that classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic regression is a powerful yet accessible tool in statistics and machine learning. It's not just about crunching numbers; it's about understanding probabilities and making decisions that are informed, precise, and reflective of the complexity of real-world situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2 Application\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Logistic Regression Application Introduction - Sentiment Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentiment Analysis is a powerful technique that analyzes the emotions and opinions within text. In the context of movies, it can be applied to understand how audiences feel about a particular film based on their reviews. By applying Logistic Regression to this problem, we can categorize reviews as positive or negative, providing key insights for filmmakers, critics, and audiences.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Data Collection\n",
    "\n",
    "For our application, we can obtain data from datasets specifically created for sentiment analysis. The dataset we'll be working with is the Large Movie Review Dataset, also known as the IMDb dataset. This is a comprehensive collection of 50,000 movie reviews, evenly split between positive and negative sentiments. It's publicly available and can be downloaded from the [Stanford AI Lab](http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/). This has already been downloaded for this application and is available in the [aclImdb](./aclImdb/README) directory.\n",

    "#### 2.3.1 Tokenization\n",

    "\n",
    "##### 2.3.1.1 NLTK\n",
    "\n",
    "NLTK is a package for building python programs to work with human language data. `nltk.download` is a function that makes it easy to download various resources, models, etc., for different NLTK functionalities. These resources are stored online, and the download function fetches them to be used locally.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2.3.1.2 punkt\n",
    "\n",
    "`punkt` is a tokenizer model used for unsupervised machine learning tokenization. It's a pre-trained model that knows how to tokenize sentences in different European languages. We downloaded this model when we called:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "nltk_download('punkt')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2.3.1.3 word_tokenize\n",
    "`word_tokenize` is a function that breaks input text into words, which is a common task in Natural Language Processing (NLP). It uses the Punkt tokenizer to perform this task. It uses the pre-trained Punkt tokenizer model to accurately split text into sentences or words. Without it, the `word_tokenize` function doesn't have the necessary knowledge to perform the tokenization.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2.3.1.4 Example Summary\n",
    "In our code example above, we downloaded the necessary pre-trained tokenizer model called Punkt which is used by NLTK, the package often used when working with human language data. We then called the `word_tokenize` function with the text `'I love movies.'` so we can break down that text into tokens. Lastly we printed out the resulting tokens `['I', 'love', 'movies', '.']`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.3.2 Removing Stop Words\n",
    "After tokenization, the next step is to remove stop words. Stop words are common words such as 'the', 'is', 'in', which are generally ignored in text data analysis. They don't contribute to the sentiment or meaning of the text, so they are removed to reduce the dimensionality of the data and focus more on informative words.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 2.3.3 Vectorization\n",
    "\n",
    "In machine learning, text data can't be fed directly to models since the models require numerical values. Vectorization is the translation process turning words and sentences into numerical forms, making them digestible for the models. Think of it as converting text into numbers, where each word or phrase becomes a unique numerical value. This transformation not only captures individual words but also the underlying meanings and relationships within the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2.3.3.1 CountVectorizer\n",
    "One common method for vectorizing text data is to use a technique that counts the occurrence of words. We can use `CountVectorizer` from the sklearn library for this purpose. `CountVectorizer` is a feature extraction technique used in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and text mining specifically designed to convert text data into a numerical format by counting word occurrences.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's imagine we have three simple movie reviews:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. \"I love this movie.\"\n",
    "2. \"I hate this movie.\"\n",
    "3. \"This movie is great. I love it.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Using `CountVectorizer`, we can represent these reviews in the following matrix:\n",
    "\n",
    "|            | \"I\" | \"love\" | \"this\" | \"movie\" | \"hate\" | \"is\" | \"great\" | \"it\" |\n",
    "|------------|:---:|:------:|:------:|:-------:|:------:|:----:|:-------:|:----:|\n",
    "| Review 1:  |  1  |   1    |   1    |    1    |   0    |  0   |    0    |  0   |\n",
    "| Review 2:  |  1  |   0    |   1    |    1    |   1    |  0   |    0    |  0   |\n",

    "\n",
    "This matrix is now a numerical representation of the text, and it can be used as input for various machine learning models, allowing them to analyze patterns and relationships within the text data.

    "   \n",
    "2. **Building a Vocabulary**: `CountVectorizer` then builds a vocabulary by identifying unique tokens across all the documents. Each unique token becomes a feature in the resulting matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Counting Occurrences**: For each document, `CountVectorizer` counts the occurrences of each token in the vocabulary. These counts form the values of the matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Removing Stop Words (Optional)**: If specified, common words (stop words) that may not contribute to the analysis can be removed. This is done through the `stop_words` parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Creating the Matrix**: The final result is a sparse matrix, a matrix mostly filled with zeros, where each row corresponds to a document, and each column corresponds to a unique token from the vocabulary. The value in each cell represents the count of the occurrence of the token in the corresponding document (review). The result is a matrix filled mostly with zeros (sparse) because most documents only contain a small fraction of the entire vocabulary, so many counts will be zero.\n",

    "**Understanding the Plot**\n",
    "\n",
    "The ROC curve we've just plotted illustrates how the True Positive Rate (TPR) and the False Positive Rate (FPR) change as the classification threshold changes. The X-axis shows the FPR, and the Y-axis shows the TPR. Now, let's delve into what this means:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Top-Left Corner**: If the curve hugs the top-left corner, we're in luck. Our model has a high TPR and a low FPR, which is ideal. This region indicates strong performance. Lucky for us, this is our case.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Diagonal Line**: If the curve were to be close to the diagonal line running from the bottom-left corner to the top-right corner, then the model would be performing no better than just randomly guessing. If this were our case, our model's ability to discriminate between the positive and negative class would be rather weak.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Curve Smoothness**: A smoother curve generally indicates that the model's performance is consistent across different threshold values. In contrast, a \"jagged\" curve might suggest that the model is unstable at certain thresholds.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Practical Implications**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Model Selection**: If we had multiple models to choose from, the various model's ROC curves can be plotted on the same graph to provide a visual comparison. The model with the curve that is more to the top-left is generally the better performer.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Threshold Selection**: The curve can be a guide in choosing an optimal threshold based on specific needs. If we wanted to prioritize reducing false positives, we would look for a point on the curve that is as high as possible on the Y-axis, but to the left on the X-axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Comprehensiveness of Metrics**\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the trade-offs between TPR and FPR at various thresholds is vital because different applications may require different trade-offs. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- In medical diagnostics, having a high TPR (catching all true cases) could be more important than having a low FPR (avoiding false alarms).\n",
    "  \n",
    "- In a spam detection system, keeping FPR low (not flagging genuine emails as spam) might be more crucial than a high TPR (catching all spam).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model Tuning and Robustness**\n",
    "\n",
    "The ROC curve doesn't just show how well a model is doing; it offers insights into how it can be made better. If our curve wasn't close to the top-left corner, we could:\n",
    "- consider more feature engineering.\n",
    "- Try different algorithms that might be better suited to our data distribution.\n",
    "- Look into techniques to balance class distribution if our dataset was imbalanced.\n",
    "\n",
    "By understanding the detailed behavior of your model through the ROC curve and AUC, you're better equipped to fine-tune it, make more informed decisions, and ultimately build a more robust, reliable model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.7 Improving the Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Improving a machine learning model is an iterative process. Once you've established a baseline with your initial model and examined its performance through metrics and visualizations like the ROC curve, the next logical step is to seek improvements. Below are several strategies tailored for sentiment analysis in movie reviews:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.7.1 Feature Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature engineering is pivotal in enhancing a model's performance. In the realm of text data, especially for sentiment analysis, there are a few primary techniques: Stemming and Lemmatization, [Stop-Word Removal](#232-removing-stop-words), and [Text Vectorization](#233-vectorization). We've already discussed stop words and text vectorization, so let's instead dive in to Stemming and Lemmatization.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2.7.1.1 Stemming and Lemmatization\n",
    "\n",
    "These techniques reduce words to their root forms, making it easier for the model to generalize across various forms of a word.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Stemming**: It's a bit crude but faster. Words are reduced to their root by removing suffixes.\n",
    "- **Lemmatization**: More sophisticated, it considers the morphological analysis of the words and usually requires more computational power.\n"

    "\n",
    "In the context of logistic regression, a solver is essentially the optimization algorithm that you use to find the model parameters that minimize the cost function. You can think of it as the \"engine\" that powers the logistic regression model's learning process. Iterations are the number of passes the optimization algorithm will make through the training dataset to update the model parameters. Too few iterations can result in an underfit model, while too many may lead to overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Different solvers and the number of iterations can also impact model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Different Types of Solvers**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are various types of solvers, each with its own set of advantages and disadvantages. Here's a brief overview:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`newton-cg`**: This solver utilizes the Newton-Raphson method for optimization. It's good for handling multiclass problems and is well-suited for large datasets. However, it can be computationally expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`lbfgs`**: Short for Limited-memory Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno. It's an optimization algorithm in the family of quasi-Newton methods. It approximates the second derivative matrix updates with low memory usage. It's the default solver for Scikit-learn’s Logistic Regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`sag`**: Stochastic Average Gradient descent. It is a variant of gradient descent and is faster for large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`saga`**: Stands for Stochastic Average Gradient Descent Aggregated. It is an extension of `sag` that also allows for L1 regularization. It generally performs well with large datasets and high dimensionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Different Solvers?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing a solver depends on the size and nature of your data. Some solvers perform better on smaller datasets, while others are optimized for large-scale data. For example, if your data is sparse, or mostly empty or zero, and has many features, using `saga` might be more efficient."

    "In this application section, we've demystified the process of using logistic regression for real-world challenges like sentiment analysis. We started by grappling with raw data, learning how to preprocess and vectorize it for machine readiness. Then, we constructed our logistic regression model, explored its components, and assessed its performance with critical evaluation metrics. Now that you've seen the art of applying logistic regression, you may be asking, \"How does this mathematical magic really work?\" As we transition into the next section, we'll delve into the nuts and bolts of logistic regression theory, giving you a well-rounded understanding that extends beyond the application."

    "## 3 Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.1 Introduction to the Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "In [linear regression](../linear-regression/Linear%20Regression.ipynb), our goal is to predict a continuous dependent variable $ y $, such as a stock price, based on one or more independent variables $ \\mathbf{X} $. We employ the equation $ y = \\mathbf{mX} + b $, where $ \\mathbf{m} $ is a vector of coefficients, and $ b $ is the bias term. However, what if we are more interested in binary outcomes like whether a stock will rise or fall, or whether a movie review is positive or negative? This is where logistic regression enters the scene.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic regression doesn't predict an exact value for $ y $. Instead, it predicts the likelihood of $ y $ being a particular category. Questions such as \"Will the medical test be positive or negative?\" or \"Is the stock going up or down?\" can be answered using this method. How do we make this work? We plug the linear equation into a special function, called the [sigmoid function](#32-understanding-the-sigmoid-function), that maps its output to a range between 0 and 1. This mapped output can then be interpreted as a probability. In this context, a value of 1 would represent a 100% chance of a particular outcome, while 0 would represent no chance. Categories like 'Fail/Pass,' 'No/Yes,' and 'Negative/Positive' can be easily represented with this approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we looked at the theory of [linear regression](../linear-regression/Linear%20Regression.ipynb), we saw that in simpler models with a single feature, $ m $ and $ b $ are just numbers. But as our models grow in complexity—say, by including multiple features—the variables involved evolve. Here, $ \\mathbf{X} $ and $ \\mathbf{m} $ become vectors, with each element corresponding to a unique feature in $ \\mathbf{X} $. Even $ b $ can transform into a matrix, particularly in the context of multinomial logistic regression where the output can be one of multiple categories. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 Understanding the Sigmoid Function\n",
    "![sigmoid_function.png](attachment:sigmoid_function.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The sigmoid function plays a crucial role in logistic regression. In logistic regression, we don't use $ y = \\mathbf{mX} + b $ directly to predict our dependent variable $ y $. Instead, we plug $ \\mathbf{mX} + b $ into this special function called the sigmoid function, or logistic function, which maps any real-valued number into a value between 0 and 1, making it interpretable as a probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sigmoid function is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\sigma(z) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of logistic regression, the input $ z $ to the sigmoid function is actually $ \\mathbf{mX} + b $, the output of your linear model. Instead of using that output directly, we plug it into the sigmoid fuction because we want to predict probabilities, and probabilities range between 0 and 1. The sigmoid function makes sure this happens. It takes any number and turns it into a number between 0 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, what makes the sigmoid function so special? Two key properties make it desirable:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Smooth Gradient**: The function is differentiable, which means we can find the slope at any two points. This is crucial for optimization algorithms like gradient descent.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Output Range**: As mentioned, it squashes any real-valued number to lie within 0 and 1, making it an excellent choice for probability estimation.\n",
    "\n",
    "To offer an example, let's say your linear equation $ \\mathbf{mX} + b $ outputs 2 for a particular sample. Putting this into the sigmoid function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\sigma(2) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-2}} \\approx 0.88\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we have a number, 0.88, which is between 0 and 1. This means there's an 88% chance of the event we're looking at happening.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the step-by-step rundown of what we did:\n",
    "1. We first calculate $\\mathbf{mX} + b$ like you would in linear regression.\n",
    "2. We then put this result into the sigmoid function.\n",
    "3. The output is now a probability, a number between 0 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the sigmoid function helps us take our linear regression equation and use it for probability. It's what makes logistic regression suitable for classification problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note on Notation**\n",
    "The coefficients we've been calling $ \\mathbf{m} $ can also be referred to as $ \\mathbf{w} $ (for 'weights') in machine learning contexts. So, the equation would look like $ \\mathbf{z} = \\mathbf{wX} + b $.\n",
    "\n",

    "In logistic regression, just like in linear regression, we have coefficients. They are usually denoted as $ \\mathbf{w} $ and are part of the linear equation $ \\mathbf{z} = \\mathbf{wX} + b $. Here, $ \\mathbf{z} $ is what we call the \"log-odds\". The term \"odds\" here refers to the likelihood of an event occurring. When we say \"log-odds,\" we mean the natural logarithm of these odds.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.3.2 What are Log-Odds?\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, if $ p $ is the probability of an event occurring, then the odds, the likelihood of that event occurring, $ O $ are given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "O = \\frac{p}{1 - p}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The log-odds $ Z $ would then be:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Z = \\ln(O) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{p}{1 - p}\\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.3.3 Transition from Log-Odds to Odds\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, the coefficients in the equation $ \\mathbf{z} = \\mathbf{wX} + b $ tell you how much the log-odds $ Z $ change when the feature $ X $ changes by one unit. But what we often want to know is not just how the log-odds change, but how the odds themselves change. This is where the \"odds ratio\" comes in, and it's calculated by taking the exponential of the coefficient $ w $:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Odds Ratio} = e^w\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.3.4 Why Do We Care About the Odds Ratio?\n",
    "\n",
    "Log-odds by themselves aren't very intuitive. For example, if a feature's coefficient is 1.5, that number by itself doesn't tell us much. However, when we calculate the odds ratio $ e^{1.5} \\approx 4.48 $, we can say that for each unit increase in the feature, the odds of the event occurring increase by about 4.48 times, which is much easier to interpret.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.3.5 Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say you're trying to predict if a student will pass an exam based on the number of hours they've studied. After running your logistic regression model, you find that the coefficient $ w $ for the feature $ x $ 'hours of study' is 1.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Log-Odds change**: The coefficients directly relate to the change in log-odds. So if 'hours of study' increases by 1 hour, the log-odds of passing the exam will increase by 1.5 units.\n",
    "- **Odds Ratio**: Taking the exponential of the coefficient converts this change in log-odds to a change in odds, making it easier to interpret:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "e^{1.5} = 4.48\n",
    "$$\n",
    "  So, for each additional hour of study, the odds of passing the exam are 4.48 times higher.\n",
    "\n",
    "By understanding both log-odds and odds ratios, you can translate what might seem like abstract numbers into actionable insights."

    "### 3.4 Cost Function\n",
    "\n",
    "![image.png](attachment:image.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.4.1 What is a Cost Function?\n",
    "\n",
    "A cost function helps us measure how well our model's predictions match up with the actual outcomes. In simpler terms, it's like a scoring system that tells us how far off our predictions are from reality. In logistic regression, a commonly used cost function is \"Log Loss.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.4.2 The Math of Log Loss\n",
    "\n",
    "Log Loss is specially designed for problems where the outcome can be one of two possible classes (like yes/no or 1/0). Here's the equation for Log Loss for one data point:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Log Loss} = - [y \\ln(p) + (1-y) \\ln(1-p)]\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this equation:\n",
    "- $ y $ is the actual outcome (1 if the positive class, 0 otherwise)\n",
    "- $ p $ is the predicted probability of the data point belonging to the positive class\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.4.3 Why Log Loss?\n",
    "\n",
    "Log Loss is particularly useful because it takes into account the uncertainty of your prediction. We use a logarithm because the logarithm intensifies the penalties for being wrong. If the model predicts a high probability for an actual positive class (or vice versa), the Log Loss value goes down. If the model is wrong, the value goes up by a lot. In other words, the cost is high for a wrong prediction that was made with high confidence, and it's low if the prediction was wrong but made with low confidence. This makes our model strive for more accurate probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.4.4  Log Loss for Multiple Data Points\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, we have more than one data point. So, we take the average Log Loss over all data points to get a single number that tells us how well our model is doing:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Average Log Loss} = -\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} [y_i \\ln(p_i) + (1-y_i) \\ln(1-p_i)]\n",

    "### 3.5 Finding Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.5.1 The Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "In logistic regression, the main objective is to find the best-fitting model to describe the relationship between the dependent binary outcome and one or more independent variables. In other words, we want to find the best equation that can predict whether something will happen or not based on other pieces of information. The \"best-fitting model\" is the familiar equation $ \\mathbf{z} = \\mathbf{wX} + b $. The parameters we are looking to find are the coefficients $ \\mathbf{w} $, weights, and the intercept $ b $, bias. This equation predicts the 'log-odds', which is then transformed into a probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.5.2 Maximum Likelihood Estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common method used to estimate the parameters is Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE). The goal is to find the parameter values, $\\mathbf{w}$ and $b$, that maximize the likelihood of the observed data given the model. In simple terms, this method helps us find the numbers for our equation that make our predictions most likely to be true based on the data we have.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3.5.2.1 Mathematical Details\n",
    "\n",
    "The likelihood, represented as $ L $, gives us the probability of observing the actual outcomes $ Y $ given the parameters $ \\mathbf{w} $ and $ b $:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "L(\\mathbf{w}, b) = P(Y | \\mathbf{w}, b)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "When we talk about the likelihood function $ L $, we're really asking a simple question: \"How well does our model explain the data we see?\" To delve further, consider that $ y_i $ is either 0 or 1. This binary nature allows us to use $ y_i $ as a switch between $ p_i $ and $ 1-p_i $ in our likelihood function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "L(\\textbf{w}, b) = \\prod_{i=1}^{N} [p_i^{y_i} \\times (1-p_i)^{(1-y_i)}]\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $p_i$ is the predicted probability for the $i^\\text{th}$ data point and $y_i$ is the actual label. The symbol $ \\prod $ simply means we multiply these terms for all data points in our dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this likelihood equation you have two parts: $ p_i^{y_i} $ and $ (1-p_i)^{(1-y_i)} $.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, recall that $ y_i $ can only be 0 or 1 because we're only picking between two categories, 'yes'/'no' or 'positive'/'negative' for example. Think of $ y_i $ like a light switch:\n",
    "\n",
    "- When $ y_i = 1 $ (the switch is on), $ p_i^{y_i} $ becomes just $ p_i $, and $ (1-p_i)^{(1-y_i)} $ simplifies to 1.\n",
    "- When $ y_i = 0 $ (the switch is off), $ p_i^{y_i} $ turns into 1, and $ (1-p_i)^{(1-y_i)} $ is $ 1-p_i $.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, what's happening is that the equation uses the 'light switch' $ y_i $ to pick the probability term that matches the true outcome for each data point. If the true outcome is 1, it uses $ p_i $; if the true outcome is 0, it uses $ 1-p_i $.\n",
    "\n",
    "By doing this, the equation is trying to find the model parameters ($ \\textbf{w} $ and $ b $) that make these picked probabilities as high as possible, which in turn would make our model's predictions most likely correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, why do we multiply all these terms together, as given by the symbol $\\prod$? In probabilities, when we want to find the chance of multiple independent events happening together, we multiply their individual probabilities. In this case, the \"events\" are the model accurately predicting each data point.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, by multiplying all these probabilities, you're calculating the overall likelihood that your model parameters $ \\textbf{w} $ and $ b $ are correct given the observed data. The higher this product, the better your parameters fit the data, making them \"most probable.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3.5.2.2 Simplifying with Log-Likelihood\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiplying many probabilities can be computationally challenging, especially when we're dealing with a large number of data points. So, what do we do? We take the natural log of the likelihood function. This turns our product into a sum, making it easier to work with. The log-likelihood function is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\ln(L(\\textbf{w}, b)) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} [y_i \\ln(p_i) + (1-y_i) \\ln(1-p_i)]\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.5.3 Connection to Log Loss\n",
    "\n",
    "Minimizing Log Loss and maximizing log-likelihood are two sides of the same coin. They both aim to find the most probable parameters. Log Loss is essentially the negative of the log-likelihood.\n",
    "\n",
    "This equation might look familiar. It's actually the negative of our [Log Loss function](#342-the-math-of-log-loss), it's the same equation multiplied by -1:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Log Loss for one data point:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Log Loss} = - [y \\ln(p) + (1-y) \\ln(1-p)]\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So when we maximize the log-likelihood, we're doing the same thing as minimizing the Log Loss. Both actions aim to find the model parameters that make the observed data most probable.\n",
    "\n",
    "By understanding the likelihood and log-likelihood, you get a fuller picture of what logistic regression is doing. It's all about finding the model parameters that make the data you've observed as probable as possible."

    "### 3.6 Gradient Descent\n",
    "\n",
    "As with linear regression, the aim of gradient descent in logistic regression is to find the parameters that minimize the cost function. However, in logistic regression, the cost function isn't directly used, instead we use a logarithmic function, the log-loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.6.1 Mathematical Foundations\n",
    "\n",
    "To apply gradient descent to logistic regression, let's first recall some key concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Log-Likelihood**: The objective of logistic regression is to maximize the log-likelihood function. This function measures how well our model explains the observed data. Mathematically, it is expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\ln(L(\\textbf{w}, b)) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} [y_i \\ln(p_i) + (1-y_i) \\ln(1-p_i)]\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $y_i$ is the actual label (0 or 1), and $p_i$ is the predicted probability of being 1 for the $i$-th sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Log Loss**: Minimizing the negative of the log-likelihood function (or log loss) is the same as maximizing the log-likelihood function. The log loss for a single sample is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Log Loss} = - [y \\ln(p) + (1-y) \\ln(1-p)]\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The loss function we want to minimize in gradient descent is actually the average log loss, which is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Average Log Loss} = -\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} [y_i \\ln(p_i) + (1-y_i) \\ln(1-p_i)]\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here $N$ is the number of data samples, $y_i$ is the true label of the $i^\\text{th}$ sample, and $p_i$ is the predicted probability of the $i^\\text{th}$ sample being in class $1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Sigmoid Function**: We use the sigmoid function to map any real-valued number into the range of [0, 1], which we use as the predicted probability $p$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\sigma(z) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Log-Odds**: The log-odds is simply the input of the sigmoid function, and it's the linear combination of weights and features.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbf{z} = \\mathbf{wX} + b\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "The gradient descent algorithm adjusts the parameters $ \\textbf{w} $ and $ b $ iteratively to minimize the log loss. The update equations for $ \\textbf{w} $ and $ b $ in logistic regression are:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",

It essentially serves to group the various data points into classes. In logistic regression, the decision boundary is derived from the equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(y=1 | x) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-(w_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2 + \\ldots + w_p x_p + b)}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If we take the threshold for classification to be 0.5, the decision boundary can be found by setting $ P(y=1 | x) $ to 0.5, which simplifies to:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "w_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2 + \\ldots + w_p x_p + b = 0\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "or in a more familiar notation:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbf{wX} + b = 0\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the equation for the decision boundary. In logistic regression with only two features, this decision boundary is simply a line defined by $w_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2 + b = 0 $. Any point falling on one side of this line is predicted to belong to one class, and any point on the other side to the other class.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.7.2 Decision Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "So how do you use this decision boundary for making predictions? It depends on the threshold we specify. Since we set the threshold to $0.5$, This means that anything below this threshold is one class, and anything above it is another class. In other words:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Above the Boundary**: If $\\mathbf{wX} + b = 0 > 0 $, then $ P(y=1 | x) > 0.5 $, and the prediction is class 1.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Below the Boundary**: If $ \\mathbf{wX} + b = 0 < 0 $, then $ P(y=1 | x) < 0.5 $, and the prediction is class 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **On the Boundary**: If $ \\mathbf{wX} + b = 0 = 0 $, then $ P(y=1 | x) = 0.5 $, and you could say the model is undecided between the two classes. However, this situation is relatively rare in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "The decision boundary is an essential concept because it allows us to visualize how a logistic regression model separates classes. The geometric insights can be particularly useful for understanding misclassifications and how your model is performing on the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.7.3 Example with Code\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's use a practical example to visualize all of these concepts. Consider we have a dataset containing two features $x_1$ and $x_2$ that are to be used to predict a binary outcome $y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we'll generate some synthetic data and plot it:\n"

    "### 3.8 Evaluating Fit\n",
    "\n",
    "After your gradient descent algorithm has converged and you've found your \"optimal\" parameters $ \\mathbf{w} $ and $ b $, the next step is to see how well your model fits the data. You've been minimizing a loss function (log loss in logistic regression) to find these parameters, but a low loss doesn't always imply a high-quality model. So how do you know if the model is any good?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.8.1 Statistical Measures for Model Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3.8.1.1 Likelihood Ratio Test\n",
    "\n",
    "This test compares the fit of your model to a null model, which is a model with no predictors, just an intercept. In simple terms, this test helps you answer the question, \"Is my logistic regression model better than just guessing?\" To put it mathematically, you compare the likelihood of your data given your model, $ L(\\mathbf{w}, b) $, to the likelihood of your data given a null model $ L(\\mathbf{w_0}, b_0) $, where $ \\mathbf{w_0} $ and $ b_0 $ are parameters of a model that only includes an intercept (no features). The ratio of these likelihoods gives you an idea of how much better your model is compared to a baseline.\n",
    "\n",
    "The likelihood ratio is calculated as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{LR} = -2 \\left( \\log{L(\\mathbf{w_0}, b_0)} - \\log{L(\\mathbf{w}, b)} \\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $L(\\mathbf{w}, b)$ is the likelihood of the data given the logistic regression model and $L(\\mathbf{w_0}, b_0)$ is the null model.\n",
    "\n",
    "A large LR suggests your model is significantly better than the null model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3.8.1.2 Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)\n",
    "\n",
    "AIC estimates the relative amount of information lost by a given model. The idea is to penalize models with more parameters because they can overfit the data. The lower the AIC, the better the model. You would usually compare AIC values across multiple models; the one with the lowest AIC is often considered the best among the considered models. The AIC is calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{AIC} = 2k - 2\\log{L(\\mathbf{w}, b)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $ k $ is the number of parameters. The model with the lower AIC is usually preferred.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3.8.1.3 Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to AIC, BIC also balances fit and complexity but adds a heavier penalty for models with more parameters, making it stricter regarding complexity. It's calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{BIC} = \\log(n) \\cdot k - 2\\log{L(\\mathbf{w}, b)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $ n $ is the number of observations. A lower BIC is better, and this measure tends to favor simpler models than AIC does.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.8.2 Relevance to Logistic Regression and Gradient Descent\n",
    "\n",
    "In logistic regression, you're optimizing the log loss via gradient descent to find the best $ \\mathbf{w} $ and $ b $. But once you have them, it doesn't automatically mean your model is good or bad. Using statistical criteria like the likelihood ratio test, AIC, and BIC allows you to more formally evaluate the quality of your model. They tell you not just how well you've fit your training data, but how well your model is likely to perform on unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if your model's AIC is significantly lower than that of other models, you can be more confident that you've chosen a good set of features and that your gradient descent didn't just minimize loss—it found a model that is likely to generalize well to unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.8.3 When to Evaluate?\n",
    "\n",
    "You would typically evaluate these criteria after you've trained your model and before you deploy it to make predictions on new, unseen data. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.8.4 Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider a simplified scenario. Assume you've used logistic regression to predict whether an email is spam or not. You have two models:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Model A uses the features: email length and frequency of the word \"offer\".\n",
    "2. Model B uses the features: email length, frequency of the word \"offer\", and number of attachments.\n",
    "\n",
    "You run both models, use gradient descent to find the optimal parameters, and then calculate AIC for both:\n",
    "\n",
    "- AIC for Model A: 120\n",
    "- AIC for Model B: 125\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though Model B uses more features, its AIC is higher, indicating that it might not be better than Model A in explaining the variability in the data. Hence, you might prefer Model A for its simplicity and better AIC value.\n",
    "\n",
    "By doing so, you're not just blindly following the path of gradient descent. You're making an informed decision, and that's what makes your model robust and reliable."

    "Regularization in logistic regression works much like it does in linear regression (discussed in [Linear Regression - Deeper Dive section 2.6.3](../linear-regression/Linear%20Regression%20-%20Deeper%20Dive.ipynb)). It modifies the original log-loss function by adding a penalty term. This penalty constrains the magnitudes of the parameter vectors and prevents the model from fitting high-frequency noise, thus reducing overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary regularization techniques used in logistic regression are L1 regularization (Lasso) and L2 regularization (Ridge).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.1.1 Ridge Regularization (L2 Regularization)\n",
    "\n",
    "In Ridge regularization, the penalty term is added to the original log-loss function as follows:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "J(w, b) = - \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} [y_i \\ln(p_i) + (1-y_i) \\ln(1-p_i)] + \\alpha \\sum_{j=1}^{p} w_j^2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The components are:\n",
    "- The first part is the original log loss, which measures the model's goodness of fit.\n",
    "- The second term, $ \\alpha \\sum_{j=1}^{p} w_j^2 $, adds a penalty based on the square of the coefficients.\n",
    "- $ \\alpha $ controls the strength of the regularization.\n",

    "Both Ridge and Lasso in logistic regression serve the same core purpose as in linear regression: to prevent overfitting by adding complexity to the cost function. The choice between Ridge and Lasso or a combination of both (Elastic Net) depends on your specific needs—whether you require feature selection or just a simpler, more generalizable model."

    "### 4.2 Multiclass Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "In the realm of machine learning, there are often situations where we have more than two classes to predict. This type of classification problem is known as \"Multiclass Classification\". Unlike binary classification, which deals with two classes (e.g., \"yes\" or \"no\"), multiclass classification deals with three or more classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In multiclass classification, the goal is to assign each input sample $ \\mathbf{x} $ to one of $ K $ classes $ C_1, C_2, \\ldots, C_K $, where $ K > 2 $. \n",
    "\n",
    "The most popular algorithms for multiclass classification include:\n",
    "- **One-vs-All (OvA) or One-vs-Rest (OvR)**\n",
    "- **One-vs-One (OvO)**\n",
    "- **Softmax Regression**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.2.1 One-vs-All (OvA) and One-vs-One (OvO)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **One-vs-All (OvA) or One-vs-Rest (OvR)**: For $K$ classes, $K$ different binary classifiers, or models, are trained, one for each class. Each model is trained to separate one class from all the other classes.\n",
    "  \n",
    "2. **One-vs-One (OvO)**: Train a separate binary classifier, or model, for every pair of classes. For $K$ classes, you would end up training $ \\frac{K \\times (K-1)}{2} $ binary classifiers. Each model distinguishes between every pair of classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Between the two, OvA is generally preferred due to its scalability.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.2.2 Softmax Regression \n",
    "\n",
    "Softmax regression, or multinomial logistic regression, is a direct generalization of logistic regression for multi-class problems. Instead of one logistic regression model, you have $K$ models. Instead of using the sigmoid function, it uses the softmax function to squeeze the outputs for each class between 0 and 1 and also ensure that they sum up to 1. Given an input $ \\mathbf{x} $, Softmax Regression computes the scores $ z_k $ for each class $ k $ using a similar linear equation we used for logistic regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "z_k = \\mathbf{w}_k \\cdot \\mathbf{x} + b_k\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $ \\mathbf{w}_k $ and $ b_k $ are the weight vector and bias term for class $ k $.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Softmax Function**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Softmax function then converts these raw scores $z_k$, called logits, and converts them into probabilities. The equation for the Softmax function is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p_k = \\frac{{e^{z_k}}}{{\\sum_{j=1}^{K} e^{z_j}}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $ z_k = \\mathbf{w}_k \\cdot \\mathbf{x} + b_k $ is the raw score (logit) for class $ k $.\n",
    "\n",
    "The class with the highest probability is chosen as the output class:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\hat{y} = \\arg\\max_k p_k\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $\\hat{y}$ is the predicted label for the input $\\mathbf{x}$. It's the class that has the highest estimated probability. The $\\arg\\max$ function returns the argument, in this case, the class $k$, that gives the maximum value of $p_k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Binary classification as we've seen before, $\\hat{y}$ is 1 if $p >= 0.5$ and $0$ otherwise. In multiclass, $\\hat{y}$ is the class that maximizes $p_k$ since we have more than just the labels 0 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 4.2.2.1 Cost Function & Gradient Descent\n",
    "\n",
    "The cost function for Softmax Regression is called the \"Cross-Entropy Loss\", which generalizes the log loss we used for binary logistic regression. It is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "J(\\mathbf{W}, \\mathbf{b}) = - \\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^{m} \\sum_{k=1}^{K} y_{i,k} \\log(p_{i,k})\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $ y_{i,k} $ is 1 if the true label is $k$ and 0 otherwise. $ p_{i,k} $ is the predicted probability for class $k$ for the $i^\\text{th}$ example.\n",
    "\n",
    "For gradient descent, the gradient of this cost function with respect to each weight $ \\mathbf{w}_k $ and bias $ b_k $ needs to be computed and updated iteratively. This is similar to what we do in binary logistic regression but extended to handle multiple classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 4.2.2.2 Evaluating Fit\n",
    "\n",
    "Just as in logistic regression, evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall can be used. For comparing different models or parameter sets, metrics like AIC and BIC can also be employed.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 4.2.2.3 Softmax Example: Classifying Fruits\n",
    "\n",
    "**Given**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Classes: 'Apple' (0), 'Banana' (1), 'Cherry' (2)\n",
    "- Features: Weight and color code\n",
    "- A new fruit with features $ \\mathbf{x} = [1.1, 3] $\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1: Obtain Raw Scores (Logits)**\n",
    "\n",
    "After training your Softmax Regression model, you'll have a set of weights $ \\mathbf{W} $ and biases $ b $ for each class. These are used to calculate the raw scores or logits $ z $.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's make up some logits for the example:\n",
    "- $ z_0 = 1.5 $ (Logit for 'Apple')\n",
    "- $ z_1 = 0.9 $ (Logit for 'Banana')\n",
    "- $ z_2 = 0.3 $ (Logit for 'Cherry')\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2: Calculate Probabilities using Softmax**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Softmax function transforms these logits into probabilities $ p $. The formula is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p_k = \\frac{e^{z_k}}{\\sum_{j=1}^{K} e^{z_j}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this formula, we calculate the probabilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $ p_0 = \\frac{e^{1.5}}{e^{1.5} + e^{0.9} + e^{0.3}} $\n",
    "- $ p_1 = \\frac{e^{0.9}}{e^{1.5} + e^{0.9} + e^{0.3}} $\n",
    "- $ p_2 = \\frac{e^{0.3}}{e^{1.5} + e^{0.9} + e^{0.3}} $\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume after calculation:\n",
    "- $ p_0 = 0.6 $\n",
    "- $ p_1 = 0.3 $\n",
    "- $ p_2 = 0.1 $\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3: Make a Prediction**\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we pick the class with the highest probability as the predicted class. In mathematical terms, we use $ \\arg\\max_k p_k $.\n",
    "\n",
    "- $ \\hat{y} = \\arg\\max_k (0.6, 0.3, 0.1) $ \n",
    "- $ \\hat{y} = 0 $\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the model would classify the new fruit as an 'Apple' because $ p_0 $ is the highest probability (0.6).\n",
    "\n",
    "The Softmax function ensures that all probabilities sum to 1, giving a coherent probabilistic interpretation. It also provides a measure of confidence; here the model is 60% confident that the fruit is an 'Apple'."

    "\n",
    "As we've journeyed through the world of logistic regression, we've managed to accomplish a lot. Starting with the basics, we explored how logistic regression is used for classification problems, differentiating it from its linear counterpart. We delved into sentiment analysis, applying our understanding of logistic regression to build a model capable of assessing movie reviews. We also took a detour into the theory behind logistic regression, understanding the mathematics that power the algorithm—from log odds and the sigmoid function to the process of gradient descent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our work on the sentiment analysis model demonstrates the practical utility of logistic regression. The model, albeit simple, opens the door to a wider range of natural language processing applications. Understanding the theory was not merely an academic exercise; it provided us with the tools to understand model fit and evaluation, refining our approach to developing robust models.\n",
